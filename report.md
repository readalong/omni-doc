## Findings

### :orange_circle: Contract role filtering not documented
`README.md` → **Key Features**

The new CONTRACT_KEYWORDS filter and its functionality for identifying contract roles are not mentioned in the Key Features section.

**Recommended Update:**
```markdown
- **Contract Role Filtering**: Identifies contract, C2C, and temporary positions using keyword matching and categorizes them in a dedicated email section.
```

### :yellow_circle: Email content categories are outdated
`README.md` → **Key Features**

The 'Customizable Email Content' feature description in the Key Features section is missing the new 'Contract / C2C Roles' category.

**Recommended Update:**
```markdown
- **Customizable Email Content**: The email report is dynamically generated, categorizing jobs into sections like "Target Companies," "Contract / C2C Roles," "MN Jobs," "Remote Jobs," and "Other Jobs" for quick review.
```
