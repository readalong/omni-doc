## Findings

### :orange_circle: Contract role filtering not documented
`README.md` → **Key Features**

The new CONTRACT_KEYWORDS filter and the 'Contract / C2C Roles' email section are not mentioned in the Key Features.

**Recommended Update:**
```markdown
- **Contract Role Filtering**: Identifies contract, C2C, and temporary positions using keyword matching and categorizes them in a dedicated email section.
```

### :yellow_circle: Email content categories are outdated
`README.md` → **Key Features**

The 'Customizable Email Content' feature description is missing the new 'Contract / C2C Roles' category in the list of email sections.

**Recommended Update:**
```markdown
- **Customizable Email Content**: The email report is dynamically generated, categorizing jobs into sections like "Target Companies," "Contract / C2C Roles," "MN Jobs," "Remote Jobs," and "Other Jobs" for quick review.
```

### :yellow_circle: Update System Architecture Diagram for Job Categorization
→ **System Architecture Diagram - Job Categorization**

The 'Categorize Jobs' step in the System Architecture Diagram needs to be updated to explicitly include the handling of 'Contract / C2C Roles'.

**Recommended Update:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Job Data Ingestion] --> B{Categorize Job}
    B --> C[Categorize as Full-time]
    B --> D[Categorize as Part-time]
    B --> E[Categorize as Contract / C2C]
    C --> F[Store Categorized Job]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

### :yellow_circle: System Architecture Diagram needs update for contract roles
`README.md` → **System Architecture Diagram**

The 'Categorize Jobs' step in the System Architecture Diagram does not reflect the new 'Contract / C2C Roles' category.

**Recommended Update:**
```markdown
F["Categorize Jobs (Target, Contract, MN, Remote, Other)"]
```

### :yellow_circle: Email content description is outdated
`README.md` → **Key Features**

The 'Customizable Email Content' feature description does not list 'Contract / C2C Roles' as a category.

**Recommended Update:**
```markdown
- **Customizable Email Content**: The email report is dynamically generated, categorizing jobs into sections like "Target Companies," "Contract / C2C Roles," "MN Jobs," "Remote Jobs," and "Other Jobs" for quick review.
```

### :white_circle: Update diagram for new job categorization
`README.md` → **System Architecture Diagram**

The 'Categorize Jobs' step in the System Architecture Diagram should be updated to reflect the inclusion of 'Contract / C2C Roles'.

**Recommended Update:**
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Configuration
        A[Config Parameters]
    end

    subgraph Data Input
        B["Historical Job URLs (CSV)"]
        C["LinkedIn Job Search"]
    end

    subgraph Core Processing
        D[Web Scraper]
        E["Filter & Deduplicate Jobs"]
        F["Categorize Jobs (Target, Contract, MN, Remote, Other)"]
        G["Generate Email Content"]
    end

    subgraph Output
        H["New Job URLs (CSV)"]
        I["Categorized Job Email"]
    end

## Architecture Diagrams

### Update System Architecture Diagram for Job Categorization

The 'Categorize Jobs' step in the System Architecture Diagram needs to be updated to explicitly include the handling of 'Contract / C2C Roles'.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Job Data Ingestion] --> B{Categorize Job}
    B --> C[Categorize as Full-time]
    B --> D[Categorize as Part-time]
    B --> E[Categorize as Contract / C2C]
    C --> F[Store Categorized Job]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```
